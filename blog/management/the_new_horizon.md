As the world moves forward, so should Horizon Hosting. That's why over the coming months, changes will be made to improve Horizon Hosting (now also known as HRZN Hosting) for everyone.

## Transparency

First of all, we want to be more transparent with our customers.
Every piece of maintenance and downtime should have a brief incident report written, to help our customers understand where we slipped up, and what we will do in the future. This will also be met with a consistent and published set of compensation rules.
Also, we will make sure to post yearly and quaterly transparency reports so everyone interested can look what has been going on for us!
Overall, we will help gain trust with our customers and help them know exactly what is going on as much as possible!

## Privacy and security

Secondly, we want to help increase privacy and security to our internal services and customer servers.
We will start by removing all our current tracking and analytics solutions, and replace them with a new privacy focused solution.
Also, we are assessing our internal protocol for password sharing and infastructure access, and improving this as much as possible to protect everyone's servers and software!

## Rebranding

Finally, we are giving Horizon Hosting a revamp!
This is going to start with our Pat Panel, where we will be giving it a whole new look and many more features.
We have also built a new website, to make our best impression on customers, which will match our overall distinguishable design!
You will also see new logos popping up around our sites, showcasing our new "HRZN" design.
In the future, we plan to make a new billing panel theme to match our design, and make managing your servers a breeze too!

## Afterword

Thank you for choosing Horizon, and we hope to improve our services for everyone, any suggestions are greatly appreciated!
As Horizon begins to expand, we want to do things right!
