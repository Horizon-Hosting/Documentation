This year has been a very big year for us at Horizon. We thank all clients for their continued support of Horizon Hosting. To say thank you, we are holding a 25% off sale this holiday period. <!--truncate--> Use code `HAPPYHOLIDAYS2022` on any new order!

## UK machine upgrade

On the 10th of December, Horizon Management travelled to a datacentre in the Midlands to install a new Ryzen 9 5900X based system which will allow for increased performance and capacity for our UK-based customers. This Â£2,000 investment will be very beneficial, and is a significant milestone for our company. 

All UK-based clients will be upgraded to this system free-of-charge in the near future - the maintenance period will be announced separately.

## Web Hosting

Horizon are constantly looking to improve our services where possible. We currently have plans to perform an upgrade to our web hosting systems, as well as bringing in more packages to allow you to host larger websites!

## Support over the Christmas Period

Support will be limited on the 25th, 26th and 27th of December, to allow the Horizon team to enjoy the Christmas period. Support responses may be delayed or not available at all.

## 2023

We at the Horizon team are very optimistic for 2023. We will continue our efforts with the rebranding, as well as putting more development time into things like our Pat Panel, as well as our website.

## Afterword

From all of us at Horizon Hosting, have a good Christmas and a Happy New Year.
