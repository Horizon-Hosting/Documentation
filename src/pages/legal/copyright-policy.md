## How to report a violation of this policy

If you are the owner of intellectual property and believe that a user of Horizon Hosting Limited is using this property without consent, you are entitled to report this violation to
us. Please note that Horizon Hosting Limited is not responsible for notifying you of any violations, you are responsible for detecting and reporting violations to us.

If you wish to report a violation of this policy, you should ensure that you have the appropriate information required to do so. You should ensure that when you create a report
it has:
- Appropriate information to identify the violator.
- The service/product that is violating this policy. (An IP/E-Mail address or Server Id)
- Information to identify yourself.
- The license of the material if applicable.
- How this policy has been violated.
-	Evidence of the violation.

For evidence of the violation, we will not accept small sections of a program's source code ("Code Snippets"), this is due to the inability to properly identify the violation. We will also not accept evidence that could be considered coincidental. Presenting any evidence like this will result in an instant denial of the report due to the report containing insufficient evidence.

We reserve the right to reject reports if we deem them to be spam, harassment, or fail to meet our criteria.

## How to issue a counterclaim against a report

If you believe that a report against you is invalid then you have the option to request a counterclaim against it. You are responsible for creating a counterclaim.

If you would like to request a counterclaim, please ensure that it contains:
- An identifier of the report (preferably the id of the report)
- The license of the material if applicable.
- How the report is invalid
- Evidence that the report is invalid

Failure to provide any of the required information above will result in the counterclaim being rejected as it does not contain enough information to determine whether the report is invalid. 

We reserve the right to reject counterclaims if we deem them to be spam, harassment, or fail to meet our criteria.
