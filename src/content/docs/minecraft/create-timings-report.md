Please ensure that your timings report is captured during a period of server lag and that it spans at least ten minutes. This will only work for Spigot and Paper servers.

## What is a timings report for?
When opening a support request for server lag or issues, we will often request a timings report from you. This allows us to identify issues or why your server is lagging.

## How to create a timings report
1. Start your server and let it run
2. When your server is lagging you can run `/timings on` (for ingame) or `timings on` (for console).
3. Capture a timings report for around 10-15 minutes, the report is being generated in the background.
4. After 10-15 minutes you can execute `/timings report` (for ingame) or `timings report` (for console).
5. The server will feedback a link to you, this is the timings report.
