The knowledgebase is a place where you can find answers to common questions, and even tutorials on how to use/setup our services! This is so that we can help you get the most out of your servers, and make sure you don't get left behind. It also helps us free up some of our resources to help other people, who have more advanced support requests.

## Contributing
**Anyone can contribute to our documentation site!** You could fix any errors you come across, update the documentation, or write up a tutorial yourself.

You can edit a page, by clicking the GitHub button at the top right of an article. However, if you want to write something up yourself, you can head over to the GitHub Repository and create a pull request. Make sure to read the README.md file, so you know what you are doing, and the guidelines for contributing.
