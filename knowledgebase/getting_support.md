Getting further support is easy! Just look at the available support options below:

**Billing enquiries and refund requests should be handled via our [Billing Panel Tickets](https://hrzn.link/billing)**!

## [Discord](https://hrzn.link/discord)

The HRZN Discord is a friendly community full of people who are ready to help!

### Community Support Channel

In the Discord, there is a `#community-support` channel where you can ask questions and get help from fellow clients,
or our support team when they are around. This channel should be used for addon or game-related questions.

For example, DarkRP help or how to install Prometheus!

### Discord Tickets

Discord Tickets should be used for server specific issues, where you think one of our team needs to step in!

To open a ticket, go to the `#new-ticket' channel, and click the correct department.
Then, sit back and wait while one of our team comes to assist

**Please make your self aware of the support rules in this channel!**
