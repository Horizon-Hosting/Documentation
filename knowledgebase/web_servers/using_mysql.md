## What is MySQL?

MYSQL is a commonly used database storage solution, which can be used to store your game servers data, or even for Discord bots and websites!

Some examples of how MySQL could be used:

- Game servers use MySQL for gamemodes and plugins to store data, this can also help link multiple servers together.
- Web servers use MySQL in web apps to securely store data. For example, your forum posts.
- On Discord bots, MySQL can be used to store user's levelling info.
