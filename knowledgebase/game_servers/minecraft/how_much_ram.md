Various amounts of RAM will be needed for different Minecraft servers depending on their setup and intended use. A Minecraft server's performance will suffer or even crash if it has less RAM than it requires, so it's critical to know what factors influence RAM usage and how much is required. A server will typically require more RAM the more players and addons (mods/plugins) it supports.

A reminder that the following values are only a suggestion and its always better to have more RAM.

## Vanilla / Spigot / Paper
Vanilla server normally use less RAM then Spigot/Paper servers as they dont use plugins however there is a few variables to keep in mind when calculating RAM which are listed below.

| Variable | Reccomended RAM |
|----------|-----------------|
|Minecraft 1.16.4 or previous versions|3GB|
|Minecraft 1.17+|4GB|
|For every 5 additional players|+1GB|
|For every 10 additional plugins|+1GB|

## BungeeCord / Velocity
BungeeCord and Velocity servers use an extremely low amount of RAM, we recommend **500MB** as a base value however this should be increased depending on players and plugins.

| Variable | Reccomended RAM |
|----------|-----------------|
|BungeeCord / Velocity|500MB|
|For every 5 plugins|+500MB|
|For every 200 additional players|+1GB|

## Forge / Fabric
Forge and Fabric servers use a huge amount of RAM as they fully customize the game, the suggestions for amounts are listed below.

| Variable | Reccomended RAM |
|----------|-----------------|
|Minecraft 1.12.2 or previous versions|3GB|
|Minecraft 1.13 - 1.16.4|4GB|
