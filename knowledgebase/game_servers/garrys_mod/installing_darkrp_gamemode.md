description: How to install the DarkRP gamemode to your Garry's Mod server.

DarkRP is a base framework to create a crime based RP experience. There are lots of free creations and addons on the Steam workshop to make your server its own. Premium addons are also available to purchase on websites such as [gmodstore](https://gmodstore.com).

## Installing DarkRP On To Your Game Server
1. Go to your server and choose the mods tab.
2. Locate "DarkRP" under the gamemodes section and click install.
3. Locate "DarkRP Modification" under the addons section and click install. 
4. Go to the startup tab and enter "darkrp" into the gamemode variable (This is case sensitive).
5. Restart your game server.

## Troubleshooting
Please ensure you have also changed "sandbox" to "darkrp" in your game server’s gamemode variable in the startup tab.

Be careful not to modify or delete any of the core game files, as this may mean you will need to reinstall your entire Garry's Mod server!

We suggest using an additional addon called “DarkRP Modification” which allows for easy modification of the game mode. If any errors occur, check the console for any error messages to then search the error online or create a ticket.
