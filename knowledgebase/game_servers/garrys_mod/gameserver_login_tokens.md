title: Getting and installing a gameserver token (GSLT)
description: How to authenticate your server to the server list with a GSLT
---

All Garry's Mod servers can be shown publicly through the Garry's Mod server list, to do this, a GSLT needs to be installed into the server.

## Creating and Install a Gameserver Token To Your Game Server
1. Go to the [Manage Game Servers](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/managegameservers) area on the steam website and login.
2. Locate the "Create a new game server account" near the bottom of the screen.
3. Enter the App ID for Garry's Mod which is 4000 and also a memo to remember which server it is for e.g. DarkRP Server
4. Locate and copy the "Login Token" from the list of game server accounts.
5. Go to the [Horizon Networks Panel](https://hrzn.link/panel) and go to your server.
6. In the startup section, paste the gameserver token in the "STEAM ACCOUNT TOKEN" box.
7. Restart/Start the server and now the gameserver should authorise with the server list.

## Troubleshooting
Please ensure you use one token per server as using one for multiple servers will cause authentication issues leading to your players being kicked.
